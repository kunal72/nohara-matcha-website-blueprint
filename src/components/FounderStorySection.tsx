                With an MBA from Canada and a passion for wellness, Shreya founded Nohara with a single
                mission: to bring authentic, high-quality matcha to the Indian market. Her journey began
                when she discovered matcha's transformative benefits during her time abroad and realized
                the potential it held for the evolving Indian consumer.

                "Nohara was born from a vision to create something meaningfulâ€”a brand that honors
                tradition while embracing innovation. Our matcha is more than just a product; it's an
                experience that connects people to a centuries-old practice of mindfulness and wellness."
